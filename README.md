There are four players. Each player takes a turn being dealer and play proceeds to the left. Randomly choose a first person to be dealer.

1. The dealer shuffles and deals five each player. 
2. Once the cards have been dealt, each player chooses four cards to retain, then discards the other card face-down to form the "crib", which will be used later by the dealer.
3. At this point, each player's hand and the crib will contain exactly four cards. The player on the dealer's left cuts the remaining pack. The dealer reveals the top card of the lower half, called the "starter card" or "cut", and places it face up on top. If this card is a jack, the dealer scores two points for "his heels" or "his nibs".
4. Starting with the player on the dealer's left, the players each, in turn, lay one card face up on the table in front of them, stating the count—that is, the cumulative value of the cards that have been laid (for example, the first player lays a five and says "five", the next lays a six and says "eleven", and so on)—without the count going above 31. Face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) count as 10.

Players score points during the play as follows:

15 – For causing the count to reach exactly 15 a player scores two points, then play continues.  
Pair – Completing a pair (two of a kind) scores two points.  
Three of a kind is the same as three different pairs, or 6 points.  
Four of a kind is 6 different pairs, or 12 points.  
A run of three or more cards (consecutively played, but not necessarily in order) scores the number of cards in the run.  


5. If a player cannot play without causing the count to exceed 31, they call "Go". Continuing with the player on their left, the other players continue the play until no one can play without the count exceeding 31. A player is obliged to play a card unless there is no card in their hand that can be played without the count exceeding 31 (one cannot voluntarily pass). Once 31 is reached or no one is able to play, the player who played the last card scores one point if the count is still under 31 and two if it is exactly 31. 
6. The count is then reset to zero and those players with cards remaining in their hands repeat the process starting with the player to the left of the player who played the last card. When all players have played all of their cards the game proceeds to the "show".
7. Once the play is complete, each player in turn, starting with the player on the left of the dealer, displays their own hand on the table and scores points based on its content in conjunction with the starter card. 

Points are scored for:

- Combinations of any number of cards totalling fifteen (2 points)
- Runs (Number of cards)
- Pairs (Multiple pairs are scored pair by pair but may be referred to as three or four of a kind.) (2 points per pair so 2, 6, or 12)
- Four-card flush (All four cards in the hand of the same suit score four points. Number of cards.)
- Five-card flush (All four cards in the hand of the same suit as the starter card score five points. Number of cards.)
- Having a jack of the same suit as the starter card ("one for his nob [or nobs or nibs]", sometimes called the "right" jack). (1 point)


8. The dealer scores their hand last and then turns the cards in the crib face up.
9. The game ends when a player reaches the agreed upone score which is usually 61 or 121.
